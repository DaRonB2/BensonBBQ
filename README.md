Come and enjoy a delicious meal with Benson's BBQ. We have a bunch of amazing options for you to come and choose from. We offer meats from the extent of tender tri-tip to juicy brisket and everything in between.
First I would recommend scrolling through our delicious menu to find what's calling your name today. Listen carefully though because multiple items might be calling for you.
The next thing for you to do will be to now click on our order button to place the order you desire most. You can pay when your get here, the food will be hot and ready when you arrive.
Now lets find a nice show or video to watch while we get ready to eat because finally look on your site for the order ready status. Once it reads ready, come and grab your food and we hope you enjoy every last bit of it.

CODE SNIPPETS!

This was one of my favorite pieces of code because as a food lover you're favorite thing to do is always order more food. So for my food lovers out there I had to make sure there was a +1 button. In that snippet I am finding the existing order they have placed and updating that order by 1 each time the button is pressed while also resetting the total price and updating it each time the button is pressed.

The best part about any restraunt is once you finally place your order and you know your food is on the way. This code snippet is grabbing the existing order and making sure that is saved but we also want to close that order which we do and then a new order is opened and ready for the next person in line.
